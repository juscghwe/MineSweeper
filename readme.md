# Minesweeper Project (WIP)

Welcome to my **Minesweeper** project! This repository serves as a **learning ground** for me to experiment and grow as a developer. Please note that everything is a **work in progress (WIP)**, and the code might be incomplete or undergoing changes as I work through different concepts and techniques.

### 🚀 Goals:
- **Learning by doing**: This project is part of my journey to strengthen my skills in **C++**, **CMake**, **SFML**, and more.
- **Iterative development**: The project evolves as I explore new ideas, experiment with designs, and refine best practices.

### 👨‍💻 Feedback:
I'm **open to feedback and criticism**! I want to improve and grow, so if you have suggestions, feel free to share them. Constructive feedback is always welcome, as it helps me refine my approach and learn from mistakes.

### 🛠️ Status:
- This project is **not yet complete** and should be considered experimental.
- Expect frequent changes, as I explore new features and optimizations.

### 💡 Contributing:
If you'd like to provide suggestions or help me grow, feel free to submit an issue or reach out. I'm always open to learning from others.
